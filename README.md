# OrderAppPublic

A food order app I made for someone. I used sveltekit to make this project, but will soon rewrite it in React Native so I can easily port it to mobile devices ( and learn React Native ). I will only share some public non-confidential files here pretty much only the frontend stuff

Here is the initial design files

And here is the current state of design for the app ( svelteKit version )
